#Mastering TypeScript - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering TypeScript - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-typescript-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468710), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The TypeScript language, compiler, and opensource development toolset brings JavaScript development up to the enterprise level. It allows us to use ES5, ES6, and ES7 JavaScript language features today, including classes, interfaces, generics, modules, and more. Its simple typing syntax enables building large, robust applications using object-oriented techniques and industry standard design principles.


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
class MyClass {
  add(x: number, y: number) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
```

You will need the TypeScript compiler and an editor of some sort. The TypeScript compiler is available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux as a Node plugin. Chapter 1, TypeScript - Tools and Framework Options, describes the setup of a development environment.
